# 🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Fine-Tuned BERT

## 📖 Project Description
This project focuses on building an **AI-powered sentiment analysis model** that can automatically classify **Twitter comments** into three categories:
- 😊 **Positive**
- 😐 **Neutral**
- 😡 **Negative**

Using the power of **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**, the model understands the context and emotions behind tweets — going beyond keyword-based approaches.  
The project demonstrates the process of **fine-tuning a pre-trained language model** on real-world social media data to extract meaningful insights about public opinion.

## 💡 Objective
The main goal of this project is to:
- Analyze the overall sentiment of tweets
- Help organizations or brands monitor customer feedback
- Explore how transformer-based models can be applied to **text classification** and **opinion mining**

## 🧠 Key Features
- 📊 **Dataset:** Real Twitter comments used for training and evaluation  
- 🧩 **Model:** Fine-tuned **BERT** model for sentiment classification  
- ⚙️ **Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, and text normalization  
- 🧮 **Training:** Fine-tuned BERT with optimized hyperparameters  
- 📈 **Evaluation:** Model assessed using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score  
- 📊 **Visualization:** Sentiment distribution plots for better interpretability
